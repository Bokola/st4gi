\title{Compute derived traits for potato}
\usage{
cdt.pt(dfr, method = c("none", "ps", "np"), value = NULL, ntp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfr}{The name of the data frame.}

\item{method}{Method to scale data from plot to hectare level. Options are
plot size \code{"ps"} and number of plants for a full hectare \code{"np"}.
See details.}

\item{value}{Value for the method selected in square meters if \code{method = "ps"}
and in number of plants per hectare if \code{method = "np"}.}

\item{ntp}{Number of tubers planted per plot.}
}
\value{
It returns a data frame with the original and derived traits.
}
\description{
Compute derived traits for a given fieldbook data frame.
}
\details{
The data frame must use the labels (lower or upper case) listed in
function \code{check.names.pt}.
Conversion from kilograms per plot to tons per hectare can be done using
\code{ps}, the plot size, or \code{np}, the total number of plants that can be
allocated in a full hectare. In both cases computations can be adjusted by the
number of harvested plants if available in the fieldbook. For \code{method = "np"},
\code{ntp} must be specified to compute non adjusted values.
